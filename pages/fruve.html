			This project came to me as an idea for a smart fridge which could detect the items automatically through the help of camera inside the fridge. But as it is a huge project, I talk to my friend and my lecturer about this, and both of my lecturer and friend said that they could work together and write this as my friend and my graduation thesis. But with the limitation of the Convolutional Neural Network (Computer Vision) part only.
